### What it does

ARena brings the arena to you. With AR glasses, fans see e-sports come alive! Matches are projected onto the real stadium field, not a screen. You can cheer, react, and share the moment with everyone around, blending the thrill of live sports with the world of modern gaming.

---

### Inspiration

E-sports in person lacked the energy of traditional sports for us. As AR, MR, and e-sports exploded, we wanted to revive that missing feeling of connection, giving fans a way to experience matches *together* - not just as individuals in an audience, but as part of the live event.

Recent advances from Meta, like the Quest 3 and new AR prototypes, showed us what could be possible. We see ARena as a glimpse into the future of how watching, playing, and connecting are about to change for everyone.

### Challenges

Keeping every user’s view in sync was tough. Image tracking took trial and error, and the Meta dev tools demanded resourcefulness. But after many late nights, we pulled off an experience that feels smooth and *shared*.

---

#### Accomplishments

We tackled new challenges, navigated unfamiliar tools, and built a multiuser AR prototype that works in the real world. Bringing it all together, over the course of a single hackathon sprint weekend, was the achievement we’re most proud of.

---

#### What we learned

Collaborative Unity development for multiplayer, shared-space AR is a challenge of its own. From version control to scene merges, every step needs discipline and communication. Building in mixed reality, we found that even simple changes ripple across the whole experience—and a smooth process depends on staying aligned as a team and learning new tech together as we go.

---

#### What's next

Imagine any event - concerts, worldwide competitions, live 3D streams - where “front row” means wherever you are. That’s the future we see. ARena is the first step.
