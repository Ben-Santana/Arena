### What is ARena?

ARena transforms how fans experience e-sports at live venues. Instead of just watching on a screen, ARena uses Meta Quest 3 to project the match right onto the physical field—bringing everyone together in a single, social, and electrifying AR/MR experience. Feel the game come to life at your seat and react in real time with the crowd.

### Inspiration

Traditional e-sports events can fail to deliver the energy and connection of live sports. With new AR hardware and Unity's tools, our team set out to blend the best parts of digital gaming and physical stadiums, making spectating an immersive, shared event.

### How We Built It

- Developed in Unity for Meta Quest 3, focusing on AR and mixed reality.
- Used seat-based image tracking for arena anchoring—no bulky field tools required.
- Leveraged hand tracking and multiplayer features for a truly social experience.
- Designed for easy setup and instant immersion in any stadium or venue.

---

### Accomplishments

- Achieved stable, shared AR for multiple users in a real-time, live arena.
- Overcame technical and tooling challenges as a fast-moving hackathon team.
- Demonstrated that the future of sports and gaming is interactive, social, and right in front of you.

### Lessons Learned

The AR/MR space is evolving fast and every new tool means new ground to break. Our biggest gains came from creative troubleshooting, open teamwork, and relentless iteration.

### What's Next

We envision ARena powering live concerts, international matches, and new kinds of sports—all through the same AR glasses. This demo is only the first step toward a new way of connecting and experiencing games as a group.
