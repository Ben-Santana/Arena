### What it does

ARena brings the arena to you. With AR glasses, fans see e-sports come alive! Matches are projected onto the real stadium field, not a screen. You can cheer, react, and share the moment with everyone around, blending the thrill of live sports with the world of modern gaming.

---

### Inspiration

E-sports in person lacked the energy of traditional sports for us. As AR, MR, and e-sports exploded, we wanted to revive that missing feeling of connection, giving fans a way to experience matches *together* - not just as individuals in an audience, but as part of the live event.

Recent advances from Meta, like the Quest 3 and new AR prototypes, showed us what could be possible. We see ARena as a glimpse of how watching, playing, and connecting are about to change for everyone.

### How it works

ARena uses image tracking at every seat to anchor the digital arena, so every fan has a perfect, personal view that lines up with reality—no giant field markers or complex setup required. The whole experience is stable, responsive, and multi-user, thanks to headset-to-headset sync. Hand tracking makes it feel even more real.

---

### Challenges

Keeping every user’s view in sync was tough. Image tracking took trial and error, and the Meta dev tools demanded resourcefulness. But after many late nights, we pulled off an experience that feels smooth and *shared*.

---

#### Accomplishments

We combined tech we knew with tools we didn’t to make something genuinely new. Despite a wild development journey, we delivered a real, working multiuser AR prototype—and picked up a lot of know-how on the frontier of immersive tech.

---

#### What we learned

AR is still the wild west. The tools are early, the docs thin, and even the smartest AI assistants can’t always save you. Nothing beats fast adaptation and clever teamwork.

---

#### What's next

Imagine any event—concerts, worldwide competitions, live 3D streams—where “front row” means wherever you are. That’s the future we see. ARena is our first step.
